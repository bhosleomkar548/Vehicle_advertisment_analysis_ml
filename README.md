# VEHICLE ADVERTISEMENTS ANALYSIS 	

There are three problem statement

## 1.Vehicle Price Prediction

●	Pre-processed data using Python, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering.
●	Applied Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for feature selection, and trained various regression models including Linear Regression and Random Forest.

## 2.User Segmentation Analysis

●	Performed user segmentation based on advertisement behaviours using K-Means clustering.
●	Cleaned and encoded data, reduced feature with correlation, and identified user segments to enhance marketing strategies.
●	Visualized clustering results and provided descriptive statistics for each user segment.
